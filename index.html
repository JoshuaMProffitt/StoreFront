        <h3> Interesting Facts about Fishes</h3>
        <div>
            <container id = "sidebar">
            <p>1. The blobfish is actually a normal looking fish. It just decompresses when you take it out of extreme depths.</p>
            <p>2. Indonesia realized that dead Manta Rays are worth $500 whereas Manta Ray tourism brought in $1,000,000 over the life of a single Ray. Indonesia is now the largest Manta sanctuary.</p>
            <p>3. Dolphins sometimes purposefully get themselves pricked by pufferfish to get high.</p>
            <P>4. Wild salmon flesh is red because of pigments present in the krill they eat. It is the same pigment that turns lobsters and flamingos red/pink. If this pigment is not supplemented in farmed salmon, their flesh will be the normal grey color as other fishes. This is why farmed salmon is labeled as "color added".</P>
            <p>5. The Japanese considered raw salmon dangerous since Pacific salmon was prone to parasites. Norway had too much salmon and decided to focus on teaching Japanese consumers that Atlantic salmon was safe to eat raw. It took 10 years for Salmon sushi/sashimi to finally become popular.</p>
            <p>6. The use of bowls to house goldfish comes from a misunderstanding of Chinese display vessels. These were small, temporary containers that were used to display goldfish to guests. The goldfishes were otherwise housed in ponds. Fishbowls are so detrimental to goldfish's health that they are prohibited by cities like Rome on the grounds of animal cruelty.</p>
            <p>7. Odds of being attacked by a candiru are about the same as being struck by lightning while simultaneously being eaten by a shark.</p>
            <p>8. The warm-blooded Atlantic Bluefin Tuna is so powerful that when fighting fisherman it can cook its own flesh with sudden bursts of muscle activity.</p>
            <p>9. Some lakes are stocked with fish by dropping hundreds of fish out of an airplane flying over.</p>
